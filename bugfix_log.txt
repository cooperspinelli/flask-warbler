Stopfollowing, remove check

Things we need to do to make likes work:

Whenever we render a message it has to have an interactable button that can toggle like status
    In the html template, need to use if statement to see whether the message is liked or not by
    current user. Will render a different icon depending on status

Need a post endpoint to like or unlike a message

request.referrer
